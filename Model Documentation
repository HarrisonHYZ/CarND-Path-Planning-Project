The path planning model is like this:
1, Use spline.h file to create path on the current lane with 50 points ahead. In order to meet the speed limit,
  acceleration and jerk regulations, we will increase and decrease the points space gradually.
2, If there is a car in front of the ego car and the speed is lower than 49.5, the ego car try to change lane
  based on the current lane. 
3, The ego car will check the desired lane available space. If the car s position is car_s, and there is
  no car within [car_s-5, car+40] on the desired lane, it means the desired lane is available.
4, If the ego car is on the left lane, it will only check the middle lane. If the car is on the right lane, it
  will only check the middle lane. If the car is on the middle lane, it will check both of the left lane and
  the right lane.
5, When the car is on the middle lane and need to change lane and both of the left and right lanes are available,
  it will calculate the distance between the ego car and the front nearest car on the left and right lane. Then
  it will choose the lane with a bigger distance.
6, If the car needs to change lane and no lane is available, it will follow the front car on the current lane.
